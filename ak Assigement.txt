1. Write a Python that program that takes two numbers as input and the langer number.


A = int(input("Enter the 1st number"))
M =int(input("Enter the 2st number"))

if A>M:
     print("A is greater than M")
else:
     print("A is smaller than M")


OUTPUT:
     Enter the 1st number14
Enter the 2st number28
A is smaller than M

2. Create a python program that asks the user for a month {1-12} and then prints the corresponding season ("Spring","Summer","Autumn", and "Winter").

m=int(input("Enter month between 1 to 12:"))
if(m==12 or m==1 or m==2):
    print("winter")
elif(m==3 or m==4 or m==5):
    print("spring")
elif(m==6 or m==7 or m==8 ):
    print("summer")
elif(m==9 or m==10 or m==11):
    print("Autumn")
else:
    print("invalid")

Output:
Enter month between 1 to 12:6
summer



3. Write a python program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. Use the leap year rules mentioned eailer.

year= int(input("Enter the year:"))
if (year%4==0 and year%100 !=0) or (year%400 ==0):
    print("Year is leap year")
else:
    print("yearv is not leap year")

OUTPUT:
Enter the year:2000
Year is leap year

Enter the year:2002
yearv is not leap year

4. Create a program that takes on integer as input and checks if it's postive, negative, or zero. Print on appropriate message.
 num= int(input("Enter the number"))

if num >=1:
    print("postive")
elif num ==0:
    print("zero")
else:
    print("negative")
OUTPUT:
Enter the number14
postive

Enter the number0
zero

Enter the number-28
negative

5. Write a program that takes asks the user for their age and gender. Based on their age and gende. Print a message like "Your are  a young men" or "Your are a old women".

age = int(input("Enter the age"))
if age<=40:
    print("Your are a young man")
    print("Your are a young women")
else:
    print("Your are a old women")
    print("Your are a old man")

OUTPUT:

Enter the age34
Your are a young man
Your are a young women

Enter the age45
Your are a old women
Your are a old man
   
6.Create a python program that takes a temperature in celsius and convert into Fahrenheit.


temp=float(input("Enter a temperature:"))
Fahrenheit=(temp*1.8)+32
print(Fahrenheit," is Fahrenheit")

output:
Enter a temperature:28
82.4  is Fahrenheit

8.Create a program ask the user for the three numbers and then print them in ascending order.

num1=int(input("Enter First number : "))
num2=int(input("Enter Second number : "))
num3=int(input("Enter Third number : "))
if num1<num2 and num1<num3:
    if num2<num3:
        x,y,z=num1,num2,num3
    else:
        x,y,z=num1,num3,num2
elif num2<num1 and num2<num3:
    if num1<num3:
        x,y,z=num2,num1,num3
    else:
        x,y,z=num2,num3,num1
else:
    if num1<num2:
        x,y,z=num3,num1,num2
    else:
        x,y,z=num3,num2,num1
print("Numbers in ascending order are : ",x,y,z)

Output:
Enter First number : 3
Enter Second number : 4
Enter Third number : 2
Numbers in ascending order are :  2 3 4

9.Write a program that checks if a given yearis a century year .

year=int(input("Enter the year:"))
if(year%4==0 and year%100==0):
    print(year,"is a century year")
else:
    print(year,"is a not century year")

Ouput:

Enter the year:2000
2000 is a century year

10.Create a program that asks the user for a number and then determine if it is odd or even.

num=int(input("Enter a number:"))
if(num%2==0):
    print(num,"is even")
else:
    print(num,"is odd")

Output:
Enter a number:2
2 is even

Enter a number:5
5 is odd
